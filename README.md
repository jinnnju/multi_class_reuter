## Repository Overview
This repository contains three Jupyter Notebook files, each implementing different natural language processing (NLP) techniques for text clustering and classification tasks. Below are detailed descriptions of each file:

---

### 1. **`Text_Clustering.ipynb`**

#### Description:
This notebook implements text clustering using the HDBSCAN (Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm. The focus is on processing and clustering text data effectively.

#### Key Features:
- **Text Preprocessing**: Includes tokenization, stop-word removal, and vectorization techniques (e.g., TF-IDF or word embeddings).
- **Clustering with HDBSCAN**: Applies the HDBSCAN algorithm to group similar text data points based on density.
- **Visualization**: Provides visualizations of clustering results, including dimensionality reduction techniques like UMAP.

### 2. **`gpt_prompt_engineering.ipynb`**

#### Description:
This notebook leverages the GPT Turbo 3.5 model for binary classification of multilingual text data. It showcases prompt engineering techniques to enhance model performance.

#### Key Features:
- **Multilingual Support**: Handles text in multiple languages for binary classification tasks.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Demonstrates how to structure effective prompts for GPT Turbo 3.5 to maximize classification accuracy.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Includes performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### 3. **`multi-classification_reuters.ipynb`**

#### Description:
This notebook performs multi-class text classification using the Reuters dataset, a well-known benchmark for text classification tasks.

#### Key Features:
- **Dataset Preparation**: Loads and preprocesses the Reuters dataset for modeling.
- **Multi-class Classification**: Implements machine learning or deep learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, or Neural Networks) for multi-class text classification.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Provides detailed metrics such as accuracy, macro/micro F1-scores, and confusion matrix analysis.
